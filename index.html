    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">In the fall of 2000, well after the initial panic of the Y2K and collapsing dot-com bubble, I sat in front of a screen connected to a Macintosh desktop computer running HyperCard. On the screen I clicked on buttons and typed text to construct cards that would be part of a “stack” from which I, or anyone at the computer, could click through. As I recall, navigating the stack from first card to last made little sense; each card was a fragment of some concept I was thinking through with the program. HyperCard itself was a very open-ended program and channeled the notion of “low floors and high ceilings”<sup class="footnote" id="ref1_note"><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">A button, or link, could be made to connect one point in the stack to another—text and image could be composed on a canvas in a structured or unstructured way. A sequence of ideas could exist in a space that allowed for both creator and navigation to “explore” a topic in multiple directions. The stack was ephemeral but the feeling I had while constructing it was different from what I had initially believed to be the use of a piece of software; information is linearly consumed in a given container to express some point of view. In a lot of ways this was my first impressionable encounter with the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity" target="_blank" class="link">intertwingularity</a><sup class="footnote" id="ref2_note"><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>—Ted Nelson&apos;s expressive term to describe the sense that there is no neat organization of knowledge which I continue to reflect on: <em>EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED</em>.</p>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">It was soon after this experience that HTML would be more in foreground as I started to discover programs like Microsoft FrontPage that helped with the authoring of HTML through a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interfaces; where one could compose a “page” by adding elements to what seemed like a infinitely tall, and wide, document that I could assemble drawing much familiarity from Word Processing software and drawing programs. The act of assembling a website felt different from learning a programming language; content is authored by inserting elements on a page and a layout is clicked and dragged into existence as a container for words, images, and links to other pages represented as files and folders linked together.</p>
    
    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">3½-inch floppy disks became the home of most of these websites and I brought them with me from computer to computer—like an improvised sneakernet<sup class="footnote" id="ref3_note"><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup> before using free to low-cost servers—and opened them with the installed browser to share what I&apos;d made with friends. In the moment, seeing something you had made on someone else's computer felt like a gift and became an important gesture in what I was learning; the feedback loop of creating a website and being able to view it on another computer and continuing to change it over time.</p>
  
    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">I sometimes wonder what happened to those original floppy disks; I&apos;m sure the websites on them would continue to display as they had in 2000 if they found their way to a computer again. HTML, browsers, and protocols they work with, are incredibly durable spaces for people to explore in.</p>
  
    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">Creating a website this way quickly ran into its limits as I became more ambitious and, at the time, new methods and technologies were constantly being introduced. I learned in forums maintained by communities who freely talked about how they had created websites as well as viewing the source code for websites; often copying and pasting what was in <em>view source</em> so that I could try on my own (often just to better understand why things worked)</p>
  
    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">The ability to <em>view source</em> was introduced in the mid-1990&apos;s through web browsers like Netscape Navigator 3.0 released in 1996. Clive Thompson&apos;s book <em>Coders</em> notes that early versions of Netscape Navigator introduced this feature as a “fun way to let people surfing the web to see this code, if they wanted to.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref4_note"><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup> At the time called “Document Source” under the “View” menu of the running application. When clicked on a window would open showing the raw HTML of the page you were currently viewing.</p>
  
    <blockquote class="i f5 lh-copy pl4-l bn bl-l bw2 b--black-40 balanced">
      “Every single web page you visited contained the code showing you how it was created. The entire internet became a library of how-to guides on programming. If you wanted, you could cut and paste that code into a new file, change a few elements, and see what happened.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">This would be my introduction to HTML; clicking on <em>view source</em>, seeing cause and effect—editing a file then seeing the results in a browser window. On my personal websites it meant being able to adapt and remix ideas in something that felt almost like a map that was drawing itself; elements and pages acting as landmarks in the browser to be navigated between. As a self-initiated learner, being able to <em>view source</em> brought to mind the experience of a slow walk through someone else&apos;s map; their map is in a similar state of conjuring to what I was navigating on my own.</p>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">This ability to “observe” software is an important aspect of what makes HTML particularly special to work with. In particular, it&apos;s sense of “transparency” as Clay Shirky wrote in April, 1998, numerating on what makes for “good” software:</p>

    <blockquote class="i f5 lh-copy pl4-l bn bl-l bw2 b--black-40 balanced">
      “Good tools are transparent. Web design is a conversation of sorts between designers, with the Web sites themselves standing in for proposal and response. Every page launched carries an attached message from its designer which reads "I think this is a pretty good way to design a Web page", and every designer reacting to that will be able to respond with their own work”<sup class="footnote" id="ref5_note"><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content"><em>View source</em> is its own “realm” where the author could have their own presence in the browser. This could be in the form of comments, the traces of unused elements, and the idiosyncratic presentation of preformatted text. Workshops like <a href="https://designforthe.net/workshops/ascii/index.html" target="_blank">ASCII Town</a><sup class="footnote" id="ref6_note"><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup> expands on this by “pulling from concrete poetry and typewriter art, the participants created imaginary dwellings using the ASCII character table” in addition to the rich histories of ASCII art<sup class="footnote" id="ref7_note"><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup>. <em>View source</em> as a form of expression via the browser in reference to the materiality of concrete poetry and code aesthetics.</p>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">I often wonder what if the ability to <em>view source</em> was made to be more present in the browsing experience—a gesture, or invitation, to see what and how a site is composed. What if the structure of a HTML file spoke further to the content being rendered? If an element had an inner voice, what would it say? Can this history and context be expressed in the way we interact with and learn from <em>view source</em>?</p>
  
    <blockquote class="i f5 lh-copy pl4-l bn bl-l bw2 b--black-40 balanced">
      “Markup works similarly in the formulation of historical (electronic) texts. It has its own history (the versioning of SGML/HTML/XHTML), its own grammatical lineage (the development of some tags over others), its own narrative (the archaeological layers of comments attached to shared code), and even its own politics (language choices, browser compliance, and the choice to share code or retain its mystique as the writing of an invisible professional). Markup thus becomes a kind of ghostly writing dependent on context and history, rather than merely a means of formatting text.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref8_note"><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
      The ability to see marginalia through <em>view source</em> could be a place for this to happen. We can draw parallels with the physicality of a book—when you see a page in a book you are sometimes able to see the next page depending on the paper and the way it has been printed. I wonder if <em>view source</em> could be a similar gesture; a website being a porous material where its creation can be viewed at the same time. This idea draws its parallels to book publishing and the use of hidden markup from Helen J. Burgess:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="i f5 lh-copy pl4-l bn bl-l bw2 b--black-40 balanced">
      “Long before the magical moment of “View Source,” print and book producers were already using their own forms of hidden markup: the symbols written on texts that contained instructions or marked points for the purposes of textual reproduction. These printers&apos; marks are the antecedents of today&apos;s markup schema: they are marking up manuscripts in the same way we mark up electronic texts.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref9_note"><a href="#ref9">[9]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="i f5 lh-copy pl4-l bn bl-l bw2 b--black-40 balanced">
      “The HTML tags we can see in our browser&apos;s “View Source” window are akin to early printers&apos; marks: they are not readily apparent, but they can be read if we know where to look, in the process of flipping back and forth between page and source code.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref10_note"><a href="#ref10">[10]</a></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
      This brings to mind J.R. Carpenter&apos;s writing on <a href="https://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html" target="_blank" class="link">A Handmade Web</a> where a relationship is made
“between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref11_note"><a href="#ref11">[11]</a></sup>. Pages made by hand, the presence of a person in motion, manipulating a medium as an act of self-publishing as well as an act of allowing others to contribute much like <a href="https://artport.whitney.org/collection/DouglasDavis/live/" target="_blank" class="link">the world&apos;s first collaborative sentence</a> by Douglas Davis in 1994. A piece of early internet art that invited “people to contribute ‘words, photographs, video, graphics, WWW links, and sound via the Internet, the World Wide Web, email, regular mail, and personal visits.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref12_note"><a href="#ref12">[12]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
      Our cursors are often gliding from one page of the page to another in the browser window; the ease of this interaction is something, I believe, we take for granted as each element commands some level of attention by us, the viewer. A texture is created not just by the final rendered form, but also how the layout is constructed and underlying language an author imparted in constructing these documents in the form of HTML.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
      I think of this as how Alexandre Galloway describes the work of net artists, Jodi (Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans): “The resulting aesthetic is, in this way, not entirely specified by the artists&apos; subjective impulses. Instead, the texture of code and computation takes over, and computing itself—its strange logic, its grammar and structure, and often its shape and color—produces the aesthetic.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref13_note"><a href="#ref13">[13]</a></sup> For Jodi this consideration extends beyond what is shown in browsers; it includes the underlying protocols, standards, and applications that enable much of what we consider to be the internet today.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
      From the book, to HyperCard, to the internet, information is encoded and “marked-up” as instructions so that it could be rendered into their intended form. <em>View source</em> is a gesture that sits somewhere in between these moments; another space where a visitor could reside with its own aesthetic qualities and materiality. The space is both complementing and in tension with being interoperable with a browser—the precision of syntax in determining if syntax is “valid” or not to the minutiae of comments left a HTML file for us to discover and trace its creation.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
      In the end, <em>view source</em> is a reminder that software is an incredibly human activity with all its nuance, and mundanity, laid bare waiting to be viewed in our browsers. <em>View source</em> is a slow space, a gesture to see the presence of a person, and a space to come back to.

        Tkaronto is situated on land that is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. We honor the sovereignty of the Indigenous people and nations whose land we live, work and play on.
