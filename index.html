            In the Fall of 2000, after the panic of the Y2K scare and the
            collapsing dot-com bubble, I sat in front of a Macintosh desktop
            computer running a program called HyperCard. I created stacks of
            virtual cards which I, or anyone at the computer, could click
            through to freely explore. I recall that navigating my stack from
            first card to last made little sense. Each card was a fragment of
            some concept I was thinking through with the program. Linking cards
            was my first impressionable encounter with the concepts of
            <a

            ><sup class="footnote" id="ref1_note"><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup
            >—Ted Nelson’s expressive term to describe the sense that there is
            no neat organization of knowledge:
            <em>EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED </em>.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            It was soon after this experience that I started to discover HTML.
            Programs like Microsoft FrontPage helped me author hypertext through
            a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. Composing a “page”
            was done by adding elements to what seemed like an infinitely tall
            and wide document that I could assemble like Word Processing
            software and drawing programs. Like HyperCard, these programs
            considered the composing of HTML to be an open-ended
            practice—software with “low floors and high ceilings.”<sup
              class="footnote"

              ><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup
            >
            They started with the simplicity of editing elements on a page and
            allowed users to make the (often considerable) transition to
            expressing those objects in written code.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            The act of assembling a website using these pieces of software felt
            different from learning a programming language. Content was authored
            by inserting elements on a page and a layout was clicked and dragged
            into existence as a container for words, images, and links to other
            pages represented as files and folders connected together. In
            contrast, <em>view source</em> was the textual space where syntax
            was laid bare.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            The ability to <em>view source</em> was introduced in the
            mid-1990&rsquo;s through web browsers like Netscape Navigator 3.0,
            released in 1996. Clive Thompson&rsquo;s book <em>Coders</em> notes
            that early versions of Netscape Navigator introduced
            <em>view source</em> as a “fun way to let people surfing the web to
            see this code, if they wanted to.”<sup
              class="footnote"
              id="ref3_note"
              ><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup
            >
            At the time it was called “Document Source,” and located under the
            “View” dropdown menu of the running application. When clicked on, a
            window would open showing the raw HTML of the page you were
            currently viewing. The window displays a disorienting stream of text
            with traces of visible content, files, and links that feel like
            encountering a new language.
          </p>

            “Every single web page you visited contained the code showing you
            how it was created. The entire internet became a library of how-to
            guides on programming. If you wanted, you could cut and paste that
            code into a new file, change a few elements, and see what happened.”
          </blockquote>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            On my personal websites <em>view source</em> meant being able to
            adapt and remix ideas. Like drawing a map, elements and pages acted
            as landmarks in the browser to be navigated between. As a
            self-initiated learner, being able to <em>view source</em> brought
            to mind the experience of a slow walk through someone else&rsquo;s
            map.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            This ability to “observe” software makes HTML special to work with.
            In particular, it&rsquo;s sense of “transparency” as Clay Shirky
            wrote in April, 1998, numerating on what makes for “good” software:

            “Good tools are transparent. Web design is a conversation of sorts
            between designers, with the Web sites themselves standing in for
            proposal and response. Every page launched carries an attached
            message from its designer which reads "I think this is a pretty good
            way to design a Web page", and every designer reacting to that will
            be able to respond with their own work”<sup

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            I brought these early websites with me from computer to computer on
            3½-inch floppy disk—like an improvised sneakernet<sup

            before using free to low-cost servers—and opened them with the
            installed browser to share what I&rsquo;d made with friends. In the
            moment, seeing something you had made on someone else's computer
            felt like a gift. It became an important gesture in what I was
            learning, the feedback loop of creating a website and being able to
            view it on another computer and continuing to change it over time.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            I sometimes wonder what happened to those original floppy disks.
            I&rsquo;m sure the websites on them would continue to display as
            they had in 2000 if they found their way to a computer again. HTML,
            browsers, and the protocols they work with are incredibly durable
            ecosystems. You could open these websites as a series of plain text
            files using an editor. Alternatively, you could use the
            browser&rsquo;s
            <em>view source</em>
            feature; a capability that allowed me to learn how other websites
            were created by seeing markup and what is rendered in tandem.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            <em>View source</em> is still present in most web browsers as a menu
            option or a standardized address that could be typed in the address
            bar. In 2011 the IETF<sup class="footnote" id="ref6_note"
              ><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup
            >
            registered the pattern of using “view-source:https://…” to show the
            source code of a given page in plain text<sup

              id="ref7_note"

            >—a view preserving much of the author&rsquo;s formatting and
            presence. This can be in the form of comments, the traces of unused
            elements, and the idiosyncratic presentation of preformatted text.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            I often wonder what would happen if the ability to
            <em>view source</em> was made to be more present in the browsing
            experience—a gesture, or invitation, to see what and how a site is
            composed. What if the structure of an HTML file spoke further to the
            content being rendered? If an element had an inner voice, what would
            it say? Can this history and context be expressed in the way we
            interact with and learn from <em>view source</em>?
          </p>

            “Markup works similarly in the formulation of historical
            (electronic) texts. It has its own history (the versioning of
            SGML/HTML/XHTML), its own grammatical lineage (the development of
            some tags over others), its own narrative (the archaeological layers
            of comments attached to shared code), and even its own politics
            (language choices, browser compliance, and the choice to share code
            or retain its mystique as the writing of an invisible professional).
            Markup thus becomes a kind of ghostly writing dependent on context
            and history, rather than merely a means of formatting text.”<sup

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            The ability to see marginalia through <em>view source</em> could be
            a place for this to happen. We can draw parallels with the
            physicality of a book—when you see a page in a book you are
            sometimes able to see the next page depending on the paper and the
            way it has been printed. I wonder if <em>view source</em> could be a
            similar gesture, a website being a porous material where its
            creation can be viewed at the same time. This idea draws its
            parallels to book publishing and the use of hidden markup from Helen
            J. Burgess:

            “Long before the magical moment of “View Source,” print and book
            producers were already using their own forms of hidden markup: the
            symbols written on texts that contained instructions or marked
            points for the purposes of textual reproduction. These
            printers&rsquo; marks are the antecedents of today&rsquo;s markup
            schema: they are marking up manuscripts in the same way we mark up
            electronic texts.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref9_note"

            Our cursors are often gliding from one page of the page to another
            in the browser window. We take for granted the ease of this
            interaction as each element commands some level of attention by us,
            the viewers. A texture is created not just by the final rendered
            form, but also by how the layout is constructed, by the underlying
            language an author imparted in constructing these documents.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            I think of this as how Alexander Galloway describes the work of net
            artists, Jodi (Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans): “The resulting
            aesthetic is, in this way, not entirely specified by the
            artists&rsquo; subjective impulses. Instead, the texture of code and
            computation takes over, and computing itself—its strange logic, its
            grammar and structure, and often its shape and color—produces the
            aesthetic.”<sup class="footnote" id="ref12_note"
              ><a href="#ref12">[12]</a></sup
            >
            For Jodi this consideration extends beyond what is shown in
            browsers, it includes the underlying protocols, standards, and
            applications that enable much of what we consider to be the internet
            today.

            From the book, to HyperCard, to the internet, information is encoded
            and “marked-up” as instructions so that it could be rendered into
            their intended form. <em>View source</em> is a gesture that sits
            somewhere in between these moments, another space where a visitor
            could reside with its own aesthetic qualities and materiality. The
            space is both complementing and in tension with being interoperable
            with a browser—the precision of syntax in determining if syntax is
            “valid” or not to the minutiae of comments left a HTML file for us
            to discover and trace its creation.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-copy copy-content">
            In the end, <em>view source</em> is a reminder that software is a
            human activity with all its nuance, and mundanity, laid bare waiting
            to be viewed in our browsers. <em>View source</em> is a slow space,
            a gesture to see the presence of a person, and a space to come back
            to.
